# How it works

By connecting a dedicated CorGit token to a project, contributors of any kind can be rewarded with the project native token.

cg Tokens (i.e., tokens created with CorGit) have an intrinsic mechanism to preserve value over time, and to incentivize token holdings.

Whenever funds reaches the project, through grants or other channels, they are used partly to give value
to the tokens owned by current token holders, and partly to mint new tokens.

Token holders can exchange their tokens for a guaranteed value, directly on our platform, at smart contract level.
